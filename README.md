# MBot Wireless Firmware
This is an ESP32 project designed to run on the MBot Wireless Client and Host boards designed by the University of Michigan.

## Description
There are two firmwares in this project: client and host. The client board is designed to interface with the University of Michigan's Robot Control Board, the RPLIDAR A1, and a OV2640 camera.
The host board is designed as a video game style controller that can be used to drive the robot wirelessly. The host board can also act as a serial device when plugged into a laptop and commands
from the user's computer can be used to drive the robot and read the data from the robots various sensors (wheel encoders, IMU, lidar, and camera).
