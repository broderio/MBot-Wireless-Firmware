# MBot Wireless Firmware
This is an ESP32 project designed to run on the MBot Node and Command Link boards (EasyEDA projects are included in this repository) designed by the University of Michigan.

## Description
There are two firmwares in this project: command link and node. The node board is designed to interface with the University of Michigan's Robot Control Board, the RPLIDAR A1, and a OV2640 camera.
The command link board is designed as a video game style controller that can be used to drive the robot wirelessly. The command link board can also act as a serial device when plugged into a laptop and commands from the user's computer can be used to drive the robot and read the data from the robots various sensors (wheel encoders, IMU, lidar, and camera).
